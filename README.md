# Andre - sorting algoritms vizualization
Andre vizualizes some of the most common sorting alghoritms by creating a gif file

It's a little project for MIPT classes so don't expect much
Also, gifs may seem to slow for you, but you actually can't change that since .save() method has some wierd duration restrictions, so if you try to set the lower, the value will be ignored and gif would be painfully slow
